Whispers of Tomorrow

The sun dips low, the sky turns gold,
Stories of the day are softly told.
A quiet breeze, a patient star,
Reminds us who we truly are.

Each step we take, though small it seems,
Builds the road of future dreams.
So walk with hope, be brave, be kind—
The best of life is still to find.
